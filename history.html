                'description': 'Rock music, a dominant force of the 20th century, underwent significant evolution. Emerging from a fusion of blues, country, and rhythm and blues in the 1950s, pioneers like Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry brought guitar-driven sounds to the forefront. The 1960s saw the British Invasion with bands like The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, while psychedelic rock emerged with artists like Jimi Hendrix. In the 1970s, hard rock and heavy metal dominated with bands like Led Zeppelin, alongside the emergence of punk rock with The Ramones and The Sex Pistols. The 1980s brought new wave and synthpop, as well as arena rock and glam metal. The 1990s witnessed the rise of grunge with Nirvana and Pearl Jam, and alternative rock with Radiohead. In the 2000s to the present, indie rock gained prominence alongside digital influences, reshaping the genres landscape. Rock musics evolution reflects changing cultural trends while maintaining its core energy and rebellious spirit.',
